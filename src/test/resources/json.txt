Can be more.\nI sell the bands on ebay and i have materials related to the subject, but i'd like someone with knowledge in fitness. Once i selected you for the job, i will give resources like other PDF guides, copy from other sites, but obviously these have to be rewritten. I will do most of the research, but i'd like your input as well. \nBasically i'd like you to rewrite existing material, add your own, format it and nicely put the whole thing together.  \nAny questions, please ask.\n\nRichard(ID: 79262736)","clientMemberSince":"February  2007","budgetMax":150,"postedDate":1449950638,"clientRating":2,"clientJobsPosted":3,"numProposals":8,"jobURL":"https://www.elance.com/j/fitness-related-guide/79262736/","isFeatured":false,"budgetMin":0,"timeLeft":"14d, 15h","budget":"$150 or less","clientJobsAwarded":2,"isLowAwardRatio":false,"averageAmount":132,"lowAmount":85,"buyerCountryName":"United Kingdom","seoIndex":true,"hourlyRateMax":0,"clientImageURL":"https://ws.elance.com/media/images/4.0/no-photo-64x80.jpg","clientCountry":"United Kingdom","jobRegionNames":"","jobId":"79262736","clientPrivate":false,"clientJobsAwardRatio":67,"name":"fitness related guide","clientCity":"Eastbourne","clientState":"England","clientVerifiedPayment":true,"clientCountryCode":"GB","category":"Writing & Translation","subcategory":"User Guides & Manuals","jobCatId":10180,"highAmount":200,"startDate":1449950638,"hourlyRateMin":0}],"totalPages":144,"numResults":25,"page":1,"facets":{"isHourly":{"true":1355,"false":2222},"hourly_job_type":{"":2188,"12051":0,"12050":1388,"12049":1},"category":{"100":0,"10180":644,"10183":1340,"10184":647,"14000":74,"10187":46,"10186":63,"10178":484,"10179":279},"subcategory":{"14173":10,"14174":25,"14171":6,"14177":17,"12550":12,"14175":12,"10251":11,"14176":7,"10255":11,"12552":17,"10254":11,"12557":16,"12558":12,"14188":80,"14101":13,"14187":7,"12200":5,"12566":5,"10190":34,"10192":9,"10194":53,"10193":72,"10196":18,"10238":36,"12538":11,"10231":54,"10230":43,"12532":7,"10233":15,"10232":8,"12535":6,"12536":24,"10237":150,"14162":6,"14166":15,"14167":12,"10240":13,"14164":7,"14165":6,"12548":13,"12543":8,"12540":46,"14168":22,"10243":66,"12541":52,"10246":7,"10245":15,"12544":23,"10248":14,"14131":23,"12231":13,"12350":145,"14132":17,"10217":31,"10216":137,"12515":43,"10219":22,"10218":27,"12516":5,"14138":7,"14135":67,"14136":45,"10210":40,"10213":9,"14139":18,"12529":64,"10227":9,"12526":66,"12527":12,"10220":12,"11033":179,"10188":21,"10224":393,"12524":20,"10223":18,"12522":31,"10225":209,"14196":8,"14193":16,"14190":7,"14001":5,"14002":9,"10206":40,"12506":10,"10205":52,"12507":22,"10208":62,"12504":7,"10724":24,"10207":18,"10209":43,"14126":49,"14005":17,"14004":7,"10202":56,"12502":42,"10201":23,"12503":21,"10204":116,"10203":8},"budget":{"3000":2,"3483":2,"194":1,"6192":1,"350":4,"1613":5,"750":3,"2709":2,"10":4,"16":1,"1350":1,"19350":4,"3096":2,"1742":3,"400":5,"645":6,"27090":6,"800":1,"20":792,"806":1,"15480":3,"6773":3,"7740":5,"1000":119,"1484":1,"3386":1,"20318":3,"250":8,"5160":1,"774":2,"499":6,"1355":3,"1750":1,"2200":1,"30":1,"4000":1,"2100":1,"2064":1,"2580":6,"140":1,"1800":2,"387":1,"300":2,"1400":3,"700":5,"10000":16,"4515":1,"677":1,"4400":1,"4644":1,"1935":8,"2903":2,"9675":6,"-1":1781,"-2":401,"7256":1,"2000":2,"280":1,"160":1,"161":2,"9030":2,"18060":4,"320":1,"200":7,"323":2,"5225":1,"60":2,"968":3,"1548":2,"65":1,"6450":5,"5000":22,"290":1,"1680":1,"1161":1,"175":4,"210":1,"2129":1,"2800":1,"23220":2,"70":3,"13545":4,"10159":2,"3870":12,"3354":1,"581":2,"1290":3,"5805":4,"100":7,"4838":3,"12900":5,"2258":2,"500":181,"3225":5,"105":3,"1200":1,"80":2,"900":1,"5644":1,"2419":3},"status":{"open":3577}}}}
